**A spell by any other name\...**

Certain spells created by well-known wizards have more generic names in
the [5e
SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf).
Others were not included at all (so we can\'t list them here).

If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for, try removing the
inventor\'s name.
