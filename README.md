# open5e is being rebuild in Vue.js!

## Check the [Vue Refactor](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e/tree/vue-refactor) branch to see what's up.

This branch will become the new site. This build will give us substantially more flexibility than the previous Sphinx build with a similarly quick load time.

We have a discord going for discussing the rebuild, and I hope you'll join us! https://discord.gg/9RNE2rY 

Issues are being regularly updated, and Trello is also being used for non-github-related work. https://trello.com/b/uRl6j83u/open5e-development

# Legacy Sphinx Project status

DEPRECATED

At this point Sphinx will no longer build on our host (Netlify) due to a built-in bit of the script conflicting with their rules for what virtual machines can do, so we cannot update it. Any future pull requests against the main branch will be merged but won't reflect on the actual site.
