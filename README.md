# open5e is being rebuild in Vue.js!

## Check the [Vue Refactor](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e/tree/vue-refactor) branch to see what's up.

This branch will become the new site. This build will give us substantially more flexibility than the previous Sphinx build with a similarly quick load time.

We have a discord going for discussing the rebuild, and I hope you'll join us! https://discord.gg/9RNE2rY 

Issues are being regularly updated, and Trello is also being used for non-github-related work. https://trello.com/b/uRl6j83u/open5e-development

# Legacy Sphinx Project status

DEPRECATED

At this point I am discouraging new development against this branch, as the refactor is quickly approaching readiness to launch.

Our build works itermittently due to ongoing issues with Sphinx, but I will be sure to merge any text corrections as quickly as possible... they might just not make it live for a while!
